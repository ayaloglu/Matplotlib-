The data was cleaned, duplicate rows were removed from the data.

Summary statistics for Tumor volume per drug regimen was calculated

Data was rearranged and bar and pie charts were created. 

Boxplot showing Tumor volumes in Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin treated mice was generated. 

Line plot showing tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin was generated.

A scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen was generated.

A linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen was created and R square value and correlation cofficient were calculated.
